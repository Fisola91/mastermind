# README
A game where two players assume the role of code maker and code breaker. The code maker (may be a computer) sets the secret code while the code breaker (may be you) guesses the secret code. After each move by the code breaker, the code maker gives feedback to the code breaker as to how close his code is to the secret code. However, the feedback does not indicate which color is specifically referring to. It is the responsibility of the code breaker to figure it out using logic deduction.
